# Roadmap

## January 2026:
- [ ] add NEWS.md file
- [ ] add programming (boot) and research (citi) certificates
- [ ] add to education, bullet on teaching courses
- [ ] add link to professional website
- [ ] fix academic appointments section
- [ ] improve graduate assistant formatting

## Sometime Soon
- [ ] Improve citation formatting, spaced too wide, numbering bad
- [ ] add GitHub and OSF project links across the document
- [ ] consider adding additional section links in text
    - e.g., from "I am a post-doctoral fellow" to academic appointments
    - or, from education "Dissertating --" to online library record
    - (probably shouldn't go too crazy)
- [ ] consider citation formatting, automate bolding of my name
- [ ] add in my webiste and blog work where appropriate

## Eventually?
- [ ] consider switching from `vitae` to Quarto, maybe write my own template/extension?
    - There are good reasons for switching, for one, this CV means that I have to maintain a lot infrastructure that I otherwise do not use at all or at least not in this way.
